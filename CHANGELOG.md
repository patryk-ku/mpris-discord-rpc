## v0.4.0

- Added the ability to provide your own Last.fm API key via arguments and config file.
- Providing a Last.fm API key during compilation is now optional.
- Added Listenbrainz as a fallback source for album art when Last.fm doesn't provide one or API key is not set. This can be disabled with an argument or in the config.
- Added `--xdg` flag to `enable` and `disable` subcommands that creates or removes a .desktop file for XDG Autostart as an alternative to systemd for distributions without it.

## v0.3.0

- If no album art is found on Last.fm, use the `artUrl` provided by MPRIS if it exists. This is especially useful for movies played in a browser, e.g., YouTube. If a YouTube thumbnail URL is detected, replace the player icon with the YouTube icon. This can be disabled with an argument or in the config.
- Added the option to mark players as video players, which will display the status "Watching Video" and make the RPC more appropriate for movies. A video thumbnail will be displayed if available as `artUrl` in MPRIS.
- Added a new `mprisUrl` button that can link to the currently playing content if MPRIS provides such information.
- The systemd unit file is now installed by the package manager instead of manually by the program.
- Added the ability to force a different player icon and name than is actually used.

## v0.2.0

- (⚠️ **Breaking**) The previous button arguments (`-p`, `--profile-button`, `-y`, `--yt-button`) have been consolidated into a single new argument: `-b, --button` with options: `yt`, `lastfm`, `listenbrainz` and separate arguments for setting service usernames. More additional buttons coming in the future.
